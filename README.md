# BayAreaTechnologies

## Background and Overview 

The San Francisco Bay Area is the home of many top tech companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Apple. Each of those companies uses different technologies or even created their own internal tools.

With this project, my goal is to create a data visualization of various technologies used in the Bay Area top tech companies, including programming language, framework, and other information. So software engineers could use this website to prepare them for learning new tools following trending technologies.

Users will be able to check various selectors such as location or company type to filter data they are interested in or to fulfill different purposes for themselves. They will be able to mouse over individual company logo and view the detailed information about that particular company. Additionally, there is a bar chart after

## Functionality and MVP

With BayAreaTechnologies, users will be able to:

* View data on technology statistics as they relate to top tech companies in the Bay Area.
* View individual data on a particular tech company including company name, type, location, technologies used, and introduction.
* Check selectors that filter by location or company type specifying what data should be shown.

In addition, the project will include:

* A production README.

## Wireframes

The app will consist of a main section showing the data visualization with company logos, sidebar selectors to filter data, links to my Github and Linkedin.

Possible filters will include which location or company type to display. In the main section, users can mouse over a company logo to display additional information such as company name, type, location, technologies used, and introduction.

## Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* D3 for overall structure and DOM manipulation and some styling
* CSS for the remainder of the styling
* Vanilla javascript for general logic

## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1:** Get ready for the project.
Goals for the day:
- [ ] Finish design for the project structure 
- [ ] Acquire csv files for company data
- [ ] Begin learning D3 and understanding how to use it for the scope of the project

**Day 2:** Setup necessary node modules, get webpack up and running. Create webpack.config.js and package.json. Write a basic entry file and finish prep for D3. 
Goals for the day:
- [ ] Get webpack serving files and frame out index.html
- [ ] Understand d3 enough to actually be able to render some default graphs

**Day 3:** Improve understanding of d3 and begin displaying company logos on the graph and be able to organize them according to some type of filter. Start working on logic for displaying different sets of data. 
Goals for the day:
- [ ] Display company logos in some type of order
- [ ] Start writing logic for different filters

**Day 4:** Finish or come close to finishing the logic for displaying groups of different data. Write out functions for collision and also handling different size data sets. 
Goals for the day:
- [ ] Finish logic for displaying different groups data
- [ ] Write collision logic and dynamic functions that handle different amounts of data.

**Day 5:** Work on styling and css to make everything look polished.
Goals for the day:
