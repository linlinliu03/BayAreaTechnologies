# BayAreaTechnologies

## Background and Overview 

The San Francisco Bay Area is the home of many top tech companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Apple. Each of those companies uses different technologies or even created their own internal tools.

With this project, my goal is to create a data visualization of various technologies used in the Bay Area top tech companies, including programming language, framework, and other information. So software engineers could use this website to prepare them for learning new knowledge or get a sense of trending technologies.

Users will be able to check various selectors to modify the data and be able to view it in different ways or to fulfill different purposes for themselves. Additionally, users will be able to mouse over individual company logo and view more detailed information about that particular company.

## Functionality and MVP

With BayAreaTechnologies, users will be able to:

* View data on technology statistics as they relate to top tech companies in the Bay Area.
